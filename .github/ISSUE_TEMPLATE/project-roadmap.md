## 🔄 Quick Update Process
**When an issue closes (30-second update):**

1. **Get GitHub notification** → Open this roadmap issue
2. **Find the completed issue line** → Change `[ ]` to `[x]`
3. **Add to "Recently Completed" section** with date and PR link
4. **Update progress percentages** → Save

**Example update:**
```markdown
- [x] **#XXX** - [Task description] ✅ *Completed YYYY-MM-DD via PR #XXX*
```

**Progress calculation:**
- **Phase Progress**: (completed issues / total issues in phase) × 100
- **Overall Progress**: (total completed issues / total project issues) × 100

## 🏷️ Labeling System
Apply consistent labels to all related issues for easy tracking:

- **Priority**: `priority/high`, `priority/medium`, `priority/low`
- **Phase**: `phase/1-[name]`, `phase/2-[name]`, `phase/3-[name]`
- **Type**: `type/refactoring`, `type/optimization`, `type/enhancement`
- **Effort**: `effort/small`, `effort/medium`, `effort/large`

## 🤖 AI Tool Integration
This roadmap is designed for AI tool and subagent consumption:

### Structured Data Format
- Each issue follows standardized templates with clear acceptance criteria
- File references include specific line numbers for targeted work
- Code examples provide before/after implementation guidance
- Dependencies are explicitly linked for workflow automation
- **Template references**: All issues include `<!-- Template: template-name.md -->` for explicit guidance

### Recommended Subagent Specialization
- **terraform-module-optimizer**: Focus on refactoring and structural improvements
- **terraform-sre-architect**: Handle monitoring and reliability enhancements
- **terraform-security-auditor**: Review security implications of changes
- **terraform-cost-optimizer**: Ensure cost-effectiveness of optimizations
