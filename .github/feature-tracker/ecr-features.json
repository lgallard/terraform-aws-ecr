NO NEW FEATURES DISCOVERED - comprehensive analysis of latest AWS provider via HashiCorp Terraform provider documentation validates all previously discovered features. CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GAP RE-VALIDATED: image_tag_mutability_exclusion_filter remains HIGHEST PRIORITY - module supports IMMUTABLE_WITH_EXCLUSION/MUTABLE_WITH_EXCLUSION in variables.tf:31-32 but completely lacks dynamic image_tag_mutability_exclusion_filter blocks in both repository resources (repository.tf:45-117).

MAJOR MISSING FEATURES RECONFIRMED: (1) aws_ecr_repository_creation_template (organizational template-based repository creation with standardized configurations), (2) aws_ecr_account_setting (account-level ECR configuration for BASIC_SCAN_TYPE_VERSION and REGISTRY_POLICY_SCOPE). Current module implementation confirmed: aws_ecr_repository (dual pattern), aws_ecr_repository_policy, aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy, aws_ecr_replication_configuration, aws_ecr_registry_scanning_configuration, aws_ecr_pull_through_cache_rule (submodule).
